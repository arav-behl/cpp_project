# 🎬 Streamlit Dashboard - Live Demo Guide

## ✨ What's New

Your Streamlit dashboard now has **LIVE terminal output streaming** - exactly like running in the terminal, but in a beautiful web interface!

### Key Features

1. **🔴 Live Streaming** - Watch the C++ output appear in real-time
2. **⏱️ Progress Tracking** - See elapsed time and progress bar
3. **🎨 Terminal Styling** - Green-on-black terminal aesthetic (Matrix style!)
4. **📊 Auto-Results** - Automatically shows charts when complete
5. **⏹️ Stop Button** - Can interrupt simulation anytime

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas plotly
```

### 2. Launch Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py
```

### 3. Open in Browser
Streamlit will automatically open `http://localhost:8501`

---

## 🎯 What Recruiters Will See

### **Before Clicking "Run Demo":**
- Professional header with tech badges (C++20, Lock-Free Queues, etc.)
- Architecture diagram showing thread model
- Configuration sliders (duration, tick rate, z-score threshold)
- System status (✅ C++ Engine Ready)

### **During Simulation (LIVE):**
```
🔴 LIVE - C++ Engine Running

```

### **After Completion:**
- ✅ Success message
- 📊 Performance metrics (4 cards: ticks, signals, throughput, efficiency)
- 📈 Interactive charts:
  - **Signals Tab:** Pie chart + timeline scatter plot
  - **Latency Tab:** Histogram with P50/P95/P99 metrics
  - **Terminal Tab:** Full output log (scrollable)

---

## 🎨 Why This is Impressive

### 1. **Live Streaming Shows Real Performance**
Recruiters see the C++ engine working **in real-time**, not just final results. This proves:
- ✅ System is actually running C++ (not mocked)
- ✅ Performance is real (signals appearing live)
- ✅ Latency is genuine (timestamps updating)

### 2. **Professional UI/UX**
- Clean, modern design
- Intuitive controls
- Beautiful charts (Plotly interactive)
- Responsive layout

### 3. **Technical Credibility**
- Shows raw terminal output (not hiding anything)
- Displays actual C++ executable path
- Real-time progress tracking
- CSV data export visible

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### How Live Streaming Works

```python
# 1. Start C++ process with captured stdout
process = subprocess.Popen(
    ["./build/demo_realtime", ...],
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    text=True
)

# 2. Background thread reads lines in real-time
def stream_output(process, queue):
    for line in process.stdout:
        queue.put(line)  # Thread-safe queue

# 3. Main loop updates Streamlit UI
while running:
    new_lines = queue.get()
    output_text += new_lines
    st.markdown(f'<div class="terminal">{output_text}</div>')
    time.sleep(0.1)  # Update 10x per second
```

### Why This Works

- **Threading** - Background thread reads stdout without blocking UI
- **Queue** - Thread-safe communication between C++ process and UI
- **Polling** - UI updates 10x/sec for smooth streaming
- **Session State** - Streamlit preserves process across refreshes

## 🎪 Demo Script for Recruiters

### **1. Initial Pitch (30 seconds)**
> "This is a web dashboard for my C++ trading system. Let me show you how it processes market data in real-time."

### **2. Adjust Parameters (10 seconds)**
> "I can configure the simulation - let's run 15 seconds at 2000 Hz with a z-score threshold of 2.5."

### **3. Click "Run Demo" (30 seconds)**
> "Now watch the live terminal output - you'll see signals being detected as they happen, latency stats updating every second, and the C++ engine processing thousands of ticks per second."

### **4. Show Results (60 seconds)**
> "Once it finishes, we get automatic analytics:
> - **Ticks processed**: 120,000 in 15 seconds = 8,000 TPS
> - **Signals**: 15 detected across 4 symbols
> - **Latency**: P50 around 100μs, P99 under 1ms
> - **Charts**: Signal distribution, timeline, latency histogram"

### **5. Show Code (30 seconds)**
> "And here's the beauty - the C++ engine is a separate process. The dashboard just streams its output. This proves the low-latency claims are real, not simulated."

**Total time: 2.5 minutes**

## 📧 Including in Applications

### Email Template Addition:
```
📺 Live Demo: I've also built a web dashboard that shows the C++
engine running in real-time with live terminal output streaming:

https://github.com/arav-behl/cpp_project#streamlit-dashboard

You can run it locally with: streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py
```

### LinkedIn Post Addition:
```
🎬 Bonus: Interactive Streamlit dashboard that streams the C++
terminal output live - watch market data processing in real-time!

See the dashboard in action: [screenshot/gif]
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "C++ Engine Not Found"
**Problem:** `build/demo_realtime` doesn't exist
**Solution:**
```bash
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j8
```

### "No signals generated"
**Problem:** Z-score threshold too high
**Solution:** Lower slider to 1.5-2.0 in sidebar

### "Latency data empty"
**Problem:** CSV not written yet
**Solution:** Wait 1-2 seconds after completion, or increase duration

### Dashboard not updating
**Problem:** Streamlit caching issue
**Solution:** Refresh browser or restart with `streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py --server.runOnSave true`
