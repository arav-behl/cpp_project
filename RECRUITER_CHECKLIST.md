## 📝 Pre-Interview Prep (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Run the Demo Yourself
```bash
cd /Users/aravbehl/ntu_college/y4/cpp_project
./build/demo_realtime --duration 30 --rate 2000
```

**Watch for:**
- ✅ Latency P50/P99 numbers (should be <1ms)
- ✅ Signal detections appearing
- ✅ No crashes or errors
- ✅ Drop rate <1%

### Step 2: Screen Record a 30-Second Demo
**Tools:** QuickTime (Cmd+Shift+5 on Mac) or OBS Studio

**What to capture:**
1. Running the build command
2. Live terminal dashboard for 15 seconds
3. Final statistics output

**Upload to:** YouTube (unlisted), Loom, or add to GitHub README

### Step 3: Generate Benchmark Data
```bash
./build/demo_realtime --duration 60 --rate 5000 > benchmark_results.txt
cat data/latency_histogram.csv  # Check percentiles
```

**Add results to README** in the "Performance Benchmarks" section with your actual hardware specs.

## 🎤 Interview Talking Points (Memorize These)

### Opening (30 seconds)
> "I built a production-style low-latency market data handler in C++20 to demonstrate systems programming skills for quant roles. It uses a lock-free SPSC queue with acquire/release memory ordering to process millions of ticks per second with sub-millisecond latency. I implemented Welford's algorithm for numerically stable streaming statistics and created a multi-strategy signal engine with z-score, correlation, and mean reversion detection."

### If Asked: "Walk Me Through the Architecture"
> "The system has three main components:
> 1. **Producer thread** runs a feed simulator generating realistic market data using GBM or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models
> 2. **Lock-free SPSC queue** (64K ring buffer) with cache-line-aligned atomics to prevent false sharing - this is the critical path
> 3. **Consumer thread** runs the router which maintains per-symbol rolling statistics using Welford's algorithm and detects signals in real-time
>
> The key design choice was single-producer/single-consumer to avoid mutex overhead - we get acquire/release visibility without seq_cst barriers, resulting in predictable sub-millisecond latency."

### If Asked: "What's the Hardest Technical Challenge?"
> "Getting memory ordering correct in the SPSC queue. Initially, I had bugs where the consumer could read stale data or the producer would overwrite unread ticks. The solution was careful use of acquire/release semantics:
> - Producer uses `memory_order_release` when publishing the head pointer
> - Consumer uses `memory_order_acquire` when reading it
> - This forms a 'synchronizes-with' relationship that guarantees all prior writes are visible
>
> I also had to handle the full/empty distinction without locks - I leave one slot empty so `(next_head & MASK) == tail` means full, while `head == tail` means empty."

### If Asked: "How Would You Optimize Further?"
> "Three main directions:
> 1. **CPU pinning** - Pin producer to core 0, consumer to core 1, disable hyperthreading. This eliminates context switches and cache invalidation across cores.
> 2. **Busy-wait spinning** instead of sleep - Consumer spins on the queue instead of sleeping, trading CPU for latency (common in HFT).
> 3. **Multi-producer scaling** - Shard by symbol hash and use per-shard SPSC queues, or switch to LMAX Disruptor pattern for MPMC.
>
> I didn't implement these because they make debugging harder and the single-threaded design already hits 1M+ ticks/sec, but in production you'd absolutely do this."

### If Asked: "Why Welford's Algorithm?"
> "Two reasons:
> 1. **Space efficiency** - O(1) memory instead of storing all samples (critical for streaming data)
> 2. **Numerical stability** - The naive approach `variance = sum(x²)/n - (sum(x)/n)²` suffers catastrophic cancellation when values are large or similar. Welford updates mean and M2 incrementally, preserving precision even with extreme values like 1e9 and 1e-9 in the same stream.
>
> This is the industry standard for online statistics - used in numpy, scipy, and production trading systems."

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't say:** "It's just a toy project"
✅ **Instead:** "I built this to mirror production patterns used at firms like LMAX and Bloomberg"

❌ **Don't say:** "I don't know much about memory ordering"
✅ **Instead:** "I used acquire/release semantics because seq_cst would be overkill here and hurt performance"

❌ **Don't say:** "The code is messy in some places"
✅ **Instead:** "It's header-only by design for aggressive compiler optimizations, which is common in low-latency systems"

## 💡 Questions to Ask Them (Show Interest)

1. **"What are the latency requirements for your production systems?"**
   - Shows you understand performance targets

2. **"Do you use lock-free data structures, or do you have a proprietary queue implementation?"**
   - Shows you know the landscape (LMAX Disruptor, etc.)

3. **"How do you handle numerical stability in your pricing models?"**
   - Quant-specific, shows domain knowledge

4. **"What does your observability look like - do you track P99 latency at the microsecond level?"**
   - Shows you think about production operations

---

## 🎬 Demo Script (If They Ask for Live Demo)

1. **Start:** "Let me run a quick 30-second demo"
   ```bash
   ./build/demo_realtime --duration 30 --rate 2000
   ```

2. **While running:** "The dashboard updates every second showing:
   - Ticks processed per second (should be 8-10k for 4 symbols at 2kHz)
   - Queue fill percentage (usually <20%)
   - Latency percentiles (P50 around 100μs, P99 under 1ms)
   - Signal detections as they fire"

3. **After finishing:** "The system generated X signals with Y average latency. The data is exported to CSV for further analysis - this is how I'd feed into a backtesting framework."
